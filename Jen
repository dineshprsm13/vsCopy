Problem Statement:
Currently, we need to manually pull changes from our application to update the Jenkins/YAML file, which requires creating a story, defining testing scenarios, and going through an OTA review. This lengthy process delays updates and sometimes leads to unclear property definitions.

Target State:
We aim to provide a UI-based solution for accessing and updating the Jenkins/YAML file directly. This will eliminate the need for manual pulls, streamline the update process, and reduce the dependency on multiple review steps.

User Experience Enhancement:
By allowing direct updates through the UI, we can improve efficiency, ensure better property clarity, and reduce the overall cycle time for changes.
