Security component of AI, including General AI Security
introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving into an indispensable tool in various industries. Its potential to change industries is undeniable. However, the rapid development of AI, especially generative AI (Gen AI), has also brought new security challenges. This paper examines the most important aspects of AI security, focusing on Zen AI, covering an introduction, analysis, framework and conclusions.

AI security encompasses a wide range of concerns, including data privacy, model security, and adversary attacks. Gen AI compounds these challenges with the ability to generate human-like text, images and code. Some of the major security risks associated with AI and General AI include:

Data privacy: AI models are trained on large amounts of data, and often contain sensitive personal information. Unauthorized access or downloading of this data can have serious consequences.
Adequate Security: AI models are intellectual property and require protection from theft, technological tampering, and tampering. Adversaries can manipulate models for biased or harmful effects.
Adversary attacks: Malicious actors can exploit weaknesses in AI systems by introducing carefully crafted objects to manipulate model output. These attacks can lead to incorrect decisions, system failures, or data breaches.
Bias and unbiasedness: AI models can perpetuate current social biases in training contexts, leading to discrimination. This can have important ethical and legal implications.
Deepfakes: Gen AI can be used to create more realistic synthetic media, such as fake video or audio
